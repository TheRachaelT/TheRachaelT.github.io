			   <p> 
			      Craftasia is a small, friendly semi-vanilla survival server with 2 survival world allowing for various ways to play.
                 Our peaceful world, Satoshi, is great for those who like to build and collect 
                 resources without mobs being a problem. Keep inventory is enabled in this
                 world so people don't lose items on death. <			 
                 Our hard world, Akira, is great for those who like to play vanilla and fight mobs,
				 don't mind losing items upon death and have a higher skill level.
                 This is a great server for people of all ages, races and ability levels.
                 We have a fully stocked shop which contains almost every item available in survival.
				 To go with the shop we have an economy system, which allowers players to
				 buy and sell items to the shop or to eachother. 
                 The sethome default is limited to 3 houses. We worldguard houses on request,
				 so there's no fear of being greifed or having items stolen.
				 You can also lock all your chests so only you or your friends can access them. 
				 PVP is enabled in the pvp arena, which is located at each world's spawn. 
				 Our staff are friendly and well trained. They love helping 
				 people and adressing questions & concerns that players may have.
